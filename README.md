TiCircularTimePicker
===========================================


It's a circular time picker using an old fashioned scroll wheel.
It is a Titanium Module based on the KPTimePicker by Kasper Pihl Torn√∏e from https://github.com/kasperpihl/KPTimePicker.

**iOS only** at the moment,

### Usage

	var TiCircularTimePicker = require('co.coolelephant.titimepicker');

	var pickerView  = TiCircularTimePicker.createView({
		width: 250,
		height: 250,
		increment: 2, //Minute steps in which to increment when you scroll
		minimumValue: <MINIMUM DATE>, //Time in seconds since 1 Jan 1970
		maximumValue: <MAXIMUM DATE>,
		currentDate: <START DATE>
	});
	pickerView.addEventListener('change',function(e)
	{
		Ti.API.info( "Value is: ", e.value );
	});
	win.add( pickerView );
	

Please see the example included with this module. Please note that you should place a scroll wheel image behind this view and a select button in front as per the example.
